# Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Student Scores Dataset

## Description:

In this Python project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing student scores. The project began with an initial exploration using Pandas functions like head(), info(), and others to gain insights into the structure and content of the dataset.

Following the initial exploration, I enhanced the dataset by adding some additional columns relevant to the analysis. Additionally, I identified and removed any redundant or unnecessary columns, such as the unnamed column.

One of the key aspects of the analysis was visualization. I utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create informative visualizations, starting with a distribution plot to visualize the gender distribution among students. This provided a clear overview of the gender balance within the dataset.

Furthermore, I delved deeper into the data by visualizing the relationship between parent education levels and student scores. By plotting relevant graphs, such as bar charts or scatter plots, I was able to analyze how parental education influences student performance.

Overall, this project serves as an illustrative example of how EDA techniques can be applied to gain valuable insights from a student scores dataset, enabling better understanding and informed decision-making.
